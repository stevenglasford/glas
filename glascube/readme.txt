Glascube was created in response to an overwhelming need to make a product
quickly that the mass market can touch, feel, own, and use.

The idea behind glascube was to allow for people to become aware of the
PLA material and to actually have a "product" that is able to be sold. 

Glascube has no readable information, instead all information is stored
within the structure of the cube. The cube is 169mm*169mm*169mm which is 
13^2^2. The number 13 is a luck number and almost all products made by Glas
have dimensions in intervals of 13. 

Glascube has 3 sides of information, it is smooth on the outside, and all
information is stored within the structure of the cube.

The top (xy)  can be identified by a marking for glasford.io/glascube which is
both informational in that it identifies that glasford.io created the cube,
and it also contains the product name. When scanned with a typical phone or
anything it also brings the user to the website that allows a person to buy
their own glascube. 

Please notice that glascube is spelt with undercase, unless it is at the
start of a sentance. This is also true of glasford.io.

The right side of the cube (yz) contains a unique hash that combines
a unique private signature owned by glasford.io with the information of the
owner of the cube. Cubes cannot be shared, 1 owner per cube.

The left side (xz) has a small description of the glascube. Which says the
following: "
	glascube is recyclable, when desired please bring back to glasford.io
	this cube will then be recycled into any glasford.io product.
	Restrictions apply, please visit glasford.io/recycle for more info.
